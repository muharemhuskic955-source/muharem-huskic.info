🤖 **AI Engineer & Full-Stack Developer | Building Intelligent Web Applications**

I'm Muharem Huskić, a 34-year-old technologist transitioning from full-stack web development to senior AI engineering. My mission: bridge the gap between cutting-edge machine learning models and real-world user experiences.

🎯 **What I Do:**
• Design, train, and deploy production-ready AI models (Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
• Build full-stack applications that integrate AI capabilities seamlessly
• Focus on ethical AI, scalability, and user-centric design
• Transform business problems into intelligent solutions

💼 **Current Journey:**
Working towards becoming a Senior AI Engineer by combining my web development background with advanced ML engineering skills. I specialize in taking models from Jupyter notebooks to production APIs, ensuring they're reliable, monitored, and maintainable.
